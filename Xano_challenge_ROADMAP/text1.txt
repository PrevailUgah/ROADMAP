# ✅ **Beginner‑Friendly Guide: Real‑Time Fraud Monitoring System (Lightweight Version)**  
*A simplified overview for new developers, analysts, and future contributors.*

---

# **1. What This System Does (In Plain English)**

This system watches every transaction in real time and decides:

- Should we **allow** it?  
- Should we **review** it?  
- Should we **block** it?  

It does this by combining:

✅ Basic transaction data  
✅ Historical behavior (features)  
✅ Fraud rules  
✅ AI‑generated suggestions  

Think of it as a **fraud firewall** that gets smarter over time.

# **2. The Core Database Tables (Simple Overview)**

These are the main “buckets” of information the system uses.

### ✅ **Users**
People who use the system (analysts, admins).

### ✅ **Accounts**
Customer accounts being monitored.

### ✅ **Merchants**
Where the customer is spending money.

### ✅ **Devices**
The device fingerprints used for transactions.

### ✅ **Transactions**
Every payment attempt.  
This is the heart of the system.

### ✅ **Rules**
Human‑written fraud rules.  
Example: “If amount > 500,000 AND device is new → add 40 risk points.”

### ✅ **Features**
Aggregated behavior like:

- Number of transactions in the last 1 hour  
- Total amount in the last 24 hours  

These help detect unusual patterns.

### ✅ **Rule Evaluations**
A log of which rules fired for each transaction.

### ✅ **Alerts**
Cases created when a transaction looks suspicious.

### ✅ **AI Proposals**
Rule ideas suggested by the AI.

---

# **3. How Rules Work (Simple Format)**

Rules follow a very simple structure:

```
IF field operator value THEN add score
```

Examples:

- IF amount > 500000  
- IF features.24h.txn_count > 20  
- IF currency == "USD"  

This makes rules easy to write, read, and upgrade later.

---

# **4. How the AI Helps (Beginner Version)**

The AI looks at a transaction and suggests:

- A rule name  
- A severity level  
- A score to add  
- A simple condition (field, operator, value)  
- A short explanation  

Humans still approve or reject the rule.  
The AI never acts alone.

# **5. What Happens When a Transaction Arrives**

Here’s the flow in simple steps:

### ✅ **1. Validate**
Check if the transaction has the required fields.

### ✅ **2. Enrich**
Fetch account info and recent features.

### ✅ **3. Evaluate Rules**
Go through all active rules and add up risk points.

### ✅ **4. Make a Decision**
- **Risk < 60 → Allow**  
- **60–84 → Review**  
- **≥ 85 → Block**

### ✅ **5. Trigger Background Tasks**
- Recompute features  
- Ask AI to suggest new rules (only for review/block)

This keeps the real‑time path fast.
